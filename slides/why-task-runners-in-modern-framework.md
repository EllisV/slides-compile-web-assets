## Why would I consider having task runner in my project if I am using modern framework?

* Extracting asset compilation from you web application logic (more lean)
* Ability to have more than framework asset compilation could do, e.g. jshint, unit testing
* "Use Assetic to compile, combine and minimize web assets, unless you're comfortable with frontend tools like GruntJS." - Symfony2 Documentation
